When PayPal Express Checkout is enabled in NetSuite account, a new customer record is created each time the shopper uses express checkout.

When PayPal is integrated without Express Checkout, the same customer record is used upon log-in regardless of what PayPal email login was used after clicking on the Pay with PayPal button.
