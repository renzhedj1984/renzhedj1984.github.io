Given: Credit Memo for Sales Tax Refund was issued and this is to be reflected on Sales Tax Reports


The credit memo will just have the effect of offsetting the invoice for the customer for whom sales tax was refunded to. The effects will wash out in the report, since the tax due amount is cumulative.

The Pay sales tax page will have an amount once the amount of the credit memo has already been offset by a new sales tax invoice i.e. the page will only have an amount once the tax due column is positive again.


See below for sample computation:

In the example below, sales tax charged for the whole invoice = 9
